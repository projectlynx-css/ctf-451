Hey! Are you good? Before I introduce myself, shouldn't I say welcome? Oh why not, manners right?

Welcome to the CTF - You have a group of something, somewhere? Whatsapp yeah! Joined it? No? I am really sorry then.

I know you are looking for a flag... Ok I can tell you. I just welcomed you right, and asked you something, LOL I just directly told the location of flag...

WHO AM I?
My name is um... find it yourself champion!
