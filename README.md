# 🕵️‍♂️ Al-Kawthar University CTF Series – Unsolved Challenges

Welcome to the official repository of **unsolved challenges** from the Capture The Flag (CTF) events organized by the **Computer Science Society** at **Al-Kawthar University**.

## 📌 About the CTF Series

We’ve launched an ongoing **CTF series**, held after every **mid-semester exam**, to encourage learning, problem-solving, and hands-on cybersecurity skills within our university community.


## 🔍 What's in This Repo?

This repository contains **unsolved** or **partially solved** challenges from previous CTF rounds. Each challenge folder includes:

- A brief description of the challenge
- Any attached files (binaries, code, etc.)
- Hints (if applicable)

We encourage students, enthusiasts, and contributors to try solving them, discuss approaches, and even submit write-ups or solutions via pull requests.

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome!

If you’ve solved a challenge or want to share your approach, feel free to:

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your solution in the appropriate challenge folder
3. Create a pull request

Let's learn and grow together!
